ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carl, a noob web-dev who is also interested in building quality apps and writing the cleanest code possible.  
Iâ€™m currently learning front and backend web development. Once I have that down I'll be focusing on Python. 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects to learn the tricks of the trade and hopefully make some quality contacts.
Contact me if you like the coding in my projects, could assist in projects or just want to show me some tips and tricks of the trade.

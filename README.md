👋 Hi, I’m @Carlikus
I’m interested in web-dev, building quality apps and writing the cleanest code possible.  
I’m currently learning front and backend web development. Once I have that down I'll be focusing on Python. 
I’m looking to collaborate on projects to learn the tricks of the trade and hopefully make some quality contacts.
Contact me here directly or at karatekidcanfight@gmail.com
